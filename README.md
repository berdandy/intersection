# Intersection

This project is intended to support those feeling socially isolated from COVID-19 self-quarantine.

In the last few years, various platforms have opened up their walled-garden restrictions, allowing for cross-platform play. That goes a long way to bridging the gap between people by allowing an activity that enables interaction using the tools that they already have.

However, the prospect of cross-platform play is still relatively new, and it's not an easy thing to implement on the developer side, that there's relatively few options that support ALL modern platforms -- but there are those that support a subset.
